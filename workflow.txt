1. Create model folder in src and User.ts file in model => src->model->User.ts
2. npm i mongoose and zod
3. Write the usermodel
4. Create a "schema" folder in src and create following files
    a. signUpSchema.ts
    b. verifySchema.ts
    c. signInSchema.ts
    d. acceptMessageSchema.ts
    e. messageSchema.ts
5. Write schemas in them using zod
//DB connection
6. Create lib folder and dbConnect.ts file and write dbConnection logic
//Sign Up functionality
7.Algorithm.logic
// code should effectively handle both scenarios of regestering a  new user and updating an exisisting but unverified user with a new password and verification code
If exisitingUserByEmail exsists then
    If exisitingUserByEmail.isVerified then
        success:false
    else
        save the updated user
    End if
else
    create a new user with provided details
    save the new user
End if
8.Create a file resend.ts in lib, 
    a. get api key from resend's account (https://resend.com/)
    b. npm install resend
    c. Create email template -> you can refer resend's docs for nextjs
    d. write export function by integrating api -> export const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
9. Create emailTemplates folder in the project outside of src and create verificationEmail.tsx file
    a. 
    b. write a email template of your wish
10. Create helpers folder in src and a file in it sendVerificationEmail.ts
    a. Write the data object for the verification email
11. Create signup route in api folder -> install bcryptjs
    	Algorithm:
	Code should effectively handle both scenarios of registering a new user and updating an existing but unverified user account with a new password and verification code.
	
	If existingUserByEmail exists then
		If existingUserByEmail.isVerified then
			success:false.
		Else
			 save the updated user
		End if
	Else
		Create a new user with provided new details
		Save the new user
	End if
	
		a. Check if username is already verified and taken
		b. Generate a random verifycode -> 
		const verifyCode = Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000).toString()
		c. Check if you user exists
		d. If user exists -> 
			i. Check if existingUserByEmail is verified or not
			ii. If existingUserByEmail.isVerified-> return success:false, user already exists with this email
			iii. Else -> hash the password -> update the password -> update new verify code -> update verifycode expiry -> save the updated user.
		e. If user does not exist -> hash is password, expiryDate for verifyCode expiration -> save this new user into db.
		f. Send verification email through email response 

//Next auth
12.Create auth folder in api folder, [...nextauth] folder in auth folder and options.ts and routets files in [...nextauth]
    => app->api->auth->[...nextauth]->options.ts and route.ts
    a. Providers->credentials and Configuration->callbacks in next auth docs
    c. options.ts file -> Bring in providers, pages, session and callbacks. -> create next-auth.d.ts file in types folder and declare the modules if you are getting errors in accessing user and session related things in callbacks.
    d. routes.ts -> import authOptions from options.ts -> make "handler" function and export is as GET and POST->
13. Check if username is unique
    a. create a "check-username-unique" folder in api folder and write the route.
    b. Extract query params form the url
    c. check if it is existingVerifiedUser and handle the case accordingly.
